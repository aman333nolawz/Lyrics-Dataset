From the moment I met you, ya, my life was all you, ya
You’re the star that turns ordinaries into extraordinaries, oh yeah
One after another ay, ay, everything is special ay, ay
The things you’re interested in, the way you walk or talk, and every little trivial habit of yours
[Verse 4: J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Hope world, ay)
Everyone says that I used to be so little and now I became a hero (Oh no)
I say that something like destiny was never my thing (Oh no)
World peace (No way)
A great order (No way)
I just want to keep you safe

[Bridge: RM, Halsey]
I'll tell you frankly
Sometimes I was a little stuck up
Elevated sky, expanded halls
Sometimes I prayed, let me run away
But your pain is my pain
When I realised that, I vowed to myself (Yeah)
With the wings of Icarus you gave me (Uh)
Not towards the sun but towards you
Let me fly
[Chorus: Jungkook, V, Halsey]
Oh my, my, my, (uh) oh my, my, my
I've waited all my life (All my life)
I want to be with you through everything
Oh my, my, my, (yeah) oh my, my, my (Oh, oh)
Looking for something right (Right)
Okay, now, I kinda' get it

I want something stronger (I want something stronger, I want it)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Than a moment, than a moment, love (Mo-moment, love)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is nothing stronger (ooh ooh, oh yeah)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Than a boy with) Than a boy with luv
