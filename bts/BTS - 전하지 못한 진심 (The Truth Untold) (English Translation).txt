[Verse 1: V]
Full of loneliness
This garden bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle
[Verse 2: Jungkook]
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hiding in this garden
[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
All of your warmth is real
The blue flower your hand was picking
I want to hold it but
[Chorus: Jimin]
It’s my fate
Don’t smile to me
Light on me
Because I can’t get closer to you
There’s no name you can call me
[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
You know that I can’t
Show you me
Give you me
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself
Once again I put a mask on and go to see you
But I still want you
[Verse 3: Jin]
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
I can't do that forever
I have to hide
Because I'm a monster
[Chorus: V]
I am afraid
I am shattered
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you
[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
The only thing I can do
In the garden
In this world
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
And to breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you
[Chorus: Jin]
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I had the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now
[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
I'm crying
That’s disappeared
That’s fallen
Left alone in this sandcastle
Looking at this broken mask
[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
And I still want you
