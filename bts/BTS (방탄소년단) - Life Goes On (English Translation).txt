[Intro]
I remember
I, I, I remember
Ah, ah
[Verse 1: Jung Kook, Jimin]
One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology, yeah
[Verse 2: RM]
It looks like rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop (Hey)
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that'd be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
I'm in a world of pain
This cold the damn world gave to me (Woo)
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale
A warmer breath
[Pre-Chorus: V, Jung Kook]
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To that future, let's run away
[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin]
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
[Verse 3: SUGA]
Let me tell you with this song (Ayy)
People say the world has changed (No)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing's changed
[Verse 4: j-hope, Jung Kook]
With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now but don't hide in the shadow
Once again daylight will glow
[Pre-Chorus: V & Jung Kook, Jin]
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment (Close it)
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To that future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus: All, Jimin]
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on (Oh, woah)
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by (Flies by)
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
[Outro: Jimin & V]
I remember
I, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I remember
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I remember
I, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I remember
Ah-ah, ah-ah
