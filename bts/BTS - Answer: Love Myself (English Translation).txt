[Verse 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I’m opening my eyes in the darkness
When my heartbeat sounds unfamiliar
I’m looking at you in the mirror
The fear-ridden eyes, asking the question
[Verse 2: Suga]
Loving myself might be harder
Than loving someone else
Let’s admit it
The standards you made are more strict for yourself
The thick tree rings in your life
It’s part of you, it’s you
Now let’s forgive ourselves
Our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
When winter passes, spring always comes
[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
From the eyes of the cold night
I try to hide myself
As I keep tossing and turning ey
Maybe I fell in order to take the place of those countless stars
The target of  thousands of bright arrows is me alone
[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path
[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
(I’m learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it’s all me
[Verse 3: RM]
Maybe there’s no answer
Maybe this isn’t the answer either
It’s just that loving myself
Doesn’t require anyone else’s permission
I’m looking for myself again
But I don’t wanna die anymore
Me, who used to be sad
Me, who used to be hurt
It’ll make me more beautiful
[Verse 4: J-hope]
Yes, I have that beauty
Knowing that is going
On the path to loving myself
It’s what I need the most
I’m walking for myself
It’s an action needed for me
My attitude towards myself
That’s the happiness I need for me
I’ll show you what I got
I’m not afraid because it’s me
Love myself
[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
From the very beginning
To the very end
There’s only one answer ey
Why do you keep trying to hide under your mask? (hey)
Even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation (ey)
[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path
[Bridge: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Inside of me
There’s still
That awkward part of me but (woah)
[Chorus: Jin, Jimin, Jungkook, V]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself
(I’m learning how to love myself oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path
[Outro: V, Jimin, Jungkook]
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow (woah)
(I’m learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it’s all me
