[Verse 1: Jung Kook]
You are the sunlight that rose again in my life
A reincarnation of my childhood dreams
I don't know what these emotions are
Am I still dreaming?
There is a green oasis in the desert
A priori deep inside of me
I'm so happy, I can't breathe
Everything's getting blurry
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I hear the ocean from far away
Across the dream, past the woods
I'm following this clarity
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Euphoria)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Close the door now
When I'm with you, I'm in utopia
[Verse 2: Jung Kook]
Were you wandering around
Looking for an erased dream too?
It's different from what destiny suggests
We share the same painful views
Won't you please stay in my dreams
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I hear the ocean from far away
Across the dream, past the woods
Following this clarity
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Bridge: Jung Kook]
Even if the earth crumbles
No matter who shakes this world
Don't let go of my hand
Please don't wake me up from this dream
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I hear the ocean from far away
Across the dream, past the woods
(Please donâ€™t wake me up from this dream)
Following this clarity
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Euphoria (Euphoria, oh)
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, euphoria)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Close the door now
When I'm with you, I'm in utopia
