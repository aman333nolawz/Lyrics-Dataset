[Verse 1: RM & Jung Kook]
I miss you
Saying this makes me miss you all even more
I miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time's so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other is now more difficult
It's all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on time, alone on the Snowpiercer
I want to go to the other side of Earth, holding your hand, put an end to winter
How much should my longings fall like snow
Before the days of spring return, friend?
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
I could've reached you faster
If I was snow flying in the air
[Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook, V & j-hope]
Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
How many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)
[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook]
Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Please stay, please stay there a little longer
[Verse 2: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed? (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me? (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We've changed, you know?
Just like everyone, you know?
Yes, I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
I miss you, honestly, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you
[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet
[Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook, V & j-hope]
Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)
[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jimin]
You know it all, you’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season can't last forever
[Chorus: Jimin & j-hope, Jung Kook, Jung Kook & j-hope, V]
Maybe cherries are blossoming
And winter is going to be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)
[Post-Chorus: Jin & j-hope, Jin]
Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Please stay, please stay there a little longer
