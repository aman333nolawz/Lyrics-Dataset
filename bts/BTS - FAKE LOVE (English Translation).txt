[Intro: V, Jungkook]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true
[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love
[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jungkook, J-Hope]
I wanna be a good man, just for you
I gave the world, just for you
I changed everything, just for you
But I don't know me, Who are you?
The forest just for us, you weren’t there
The route I took, I forgot
I even became quite unsure of who I was
Try babbling into the mirror, who the hell are you?
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true
[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Trying to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Trying to erase myself and make me your doll
[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love
[Verse 2: RM, Suga]
Why you sad? I don’t know. I don’t know
Smile, say 'I love you'
Look at me, even I gave up on myself
Even you can’t understand me
You say I’m unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like
You say I’m not myself which you knew well
No? What do you mean no? I’m blind
Love? What the heck is love? It’s all fake love
[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]
Woo, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why
Woo, even I, even I don’t know myself
Woo, I just know, I just know, I just know why
'Cause it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love
[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Trying to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Trying to erase myself and make me your doll
[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love
[Outro: Jimin/V, Jungkook/Jin]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true
