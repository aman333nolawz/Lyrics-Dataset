Labrinth
[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm bat-shit crazy, havin' you on my mind?
Do you think I'm helpless?
My algebra gon' equal you every time
Do you think I'm callin'?
Do you think I'm callin' out your name every night?
Girl, I have fallen for you
(What, what you say?)
[Pre-Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see?
I got everything you need
(O-only a genius could love a woman like she)
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see?
I got everything you need
(O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she)
[Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He-he's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you

Sia
[Verse 2: Sia]
(Oh!)
You’ll be my Einstein, my Newton, my Galileo, and my Hawkings
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm on my neck while I am walkin'
Please understand, yeah, I have fallen for you, you
(What, what you say?)
[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see?
I got everything you need
(O-only a genius could love a woman like me)
Sayin', oh my God (My God)
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah)
I got everything you need
(O-o-only a genius could love a woman like me)
[Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius

He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He-he's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
[Bridge: Sia with Labrinth]
(Da-na-na)
(Da-da-da-da-da-mm-da, da-na-na)
Oh my God
Dot the Is and cross the Ts
I got everything you need
Well, only a genius could love a woman like me
Oh my God
You’re the lock and I’m a key
I got everything you need
Well, only a genius could love a woman like me
[Outro: Labrinth, Sia, & (Both)]

'Cause I love a woman like you

He-he-he's a genius (Oh)
'Cause I love a woman like you
