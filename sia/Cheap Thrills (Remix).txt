Up with it, girl

Bounce with it, girl
Dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl (Bada bang bang)
[Verse 1: Sia]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
[Pre-Chorus: Sia (Sean Paul)]
'Til I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
(Just you and me)
[Chorus: Sia & Sean Paul]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control
[Verse 2: Sia]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on

[Pre-Chorus: Sia & (Sean Paul)]
'Til I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)

You're worth more than diamonds, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outta control
[Verse 3: Sean Paul & (Sia)]
Me and you, girl, you and me
Drop it to the floor and make me see your energy because

Wan' fi see the ting you have weh make me feel weak, girl (Free)
'Cause anytime you wine and kotch it
The selector pull it up and put it 'pon repeat, girl
Mi nah touch a dollar inna mi pocket
'Cause nothin' in this world ain't more than what you worth
(I love cheap thrills!)

You're worth more than diamonds, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outta control
