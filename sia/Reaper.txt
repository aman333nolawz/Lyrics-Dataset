[Verse 1]
Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I'd be found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today (Reaper)
I'm feeling good, I'ma savour it (Reaper)
Don't come for me today (Reaper)
I'm feeling good, I remember when
(Reaper)
[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no, baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no, baby, no baby, not today
But no baby, no baby, not today (Reaper)
Oh, reaper (Reaper)
Oh, no baby, no baby, not today (Reaper)
Oh, reaper (Reaper)
Oh, no baby, no baby, not today, yeah
[Verse 2]
So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today (Reaper)
I'm feeling good, I'ma savour it (Reaper)
Don't come for me today (Reaper)
I'm feeling good, I remember when
(Reaper)
[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today (Reaper)
Oh, reaper
Oh, no baby, no baby, not today (Reaper)
Oh, reaper
Oh, no baby, no baby, not today
[Outro]
(Reaper)
(Reaper)
(Reaper)
