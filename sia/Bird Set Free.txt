[Verse 1]
Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
You'd worn me down
I struggled on the ground
So lost, the line had been crossed
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No, I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[Verse 2]
Now I fly, hit the high notes
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
You held me down, but I fought back loud, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, oh, it eats us alive, oh
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, yeah
[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No, I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
