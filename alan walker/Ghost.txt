[Intro]
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost)
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost)
[Verse 1]
Today, I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost (Ghost)
Call my friends, but ain't nobody home (Home)
Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know (Know)
I'm just scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I never let it show (Show)
But I feel like a missed call on a phone (Phone)
Tryna live my life, pay-as-you-go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
[Chorus]
You know I'm like a ghost, sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
[Verse 2]
You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never solve
Stranger things to worry 'bout, I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
[Chorus]
You know I'm like a ghost, sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
[Bridge]
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost)
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost)
You know I'm like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost)
(Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost, you know I'm like a ghost)
Ooh, I'll be okay, I'll be alright, I know
Ooh, I'll be okay, I'm just scared that I'll end up alone
(Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
