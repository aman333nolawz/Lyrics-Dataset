[Chorus: Kameron Alexander]
Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out ’fore I die‚ get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high‚ never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die‚ out ’fore I die, get out 'fore I die
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Burning like a candle, both ends dripping spills loose
Ends burn heads‚ burning end bridges
Better use the stairs till your legs hurting
Running for the hills, I'm on their heels, keep their heads turning
Consider it a fair warning
My partners steady moving like it's feds on us‚ uh-uh
Probably 'cause you assuming that its meds on us, uh-uh
Kick big shit I need leg warmers chug water all love
Blood is thicker than the dreads on us (Whoa)
Now I remember that when I'm in my bag
It ain't where you from, it's where you’re at
Where them niggas at?
Time to toe tag, yeah, body bag, yeah
Karate chop the shit in half till they find my match (Fight)
Till they find me laying dead on my back
This could be my last year
Putting up a fight until I collapse
2013 I went wild for night
In 2019 I’m getting out 'fore I die
[Chorus: Kameron Alexander]
Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out ’fore I die, out 'fore I die, get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out ’fore I die, get out 'fore I die
[Refrain: Kameron Alexander]
Oh, I gotta get out 'fore I die
Oh, I gotta get out 'fore I die
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
When you started from the bottom go top forward, yeah
Name like saliva whole mouth full of it, yeah
Chasing for the clout go all out for it
Till they pull up with the toasters like a house warming, yeah
I just need my piece please, like a Reese's butter cup
Is you a punk or a power puff, huh? Toughen up
Bunk my species time to feces
Then repeat rock my CC Chanel
Just popped a CC now I'm up
When it's time for me
Show me empathy
When it ends for me
Would you fend for me?
When it's time for me
Show me empathy
When it ends for me
Would you fend for me?
[Chorus: Kameron Alexander]
Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die, get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die, get out 'fore I die
[Outro: Kameron Alexander]
It ain't where you from, it's where you at
Oh, I gotta get out 'fore I die
