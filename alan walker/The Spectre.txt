[Verse 1]
Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?
[Chorus]
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)
[Verse 2]
Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?
[Chorus]
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)
We live, we love, we lie
