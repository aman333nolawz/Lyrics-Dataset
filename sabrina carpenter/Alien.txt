[Intro: Sabrina Carpenter]
Mmm, no, hmm
[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
This feeling's so alien
Need to know if you're just a friend
Are you a secret I'm holdin' in?
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
Lie but I notice it
Don't know the rules but I got to win
The paranoia is sinkin' in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
When you're really wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night
[Drop: Sabrina Carpenter]
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Alienated them
Right about when our love began
Emotions are moving in
Getting in my space, livin' in my place
When did these games begin?
I'm overthinking my thoughts again
No, we don't break, but we're bound to bend
Getting in my space, livin' in my place
[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Baby no, don't let me
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
'Cause I know you're wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night
[Drop: Sabrina Carpenter]
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night (Be a better night)
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night (No, no, no)
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
A better night, yeah
