[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the edge
And everything I know has blown away
Life is upside down
But any way it goes, I'll work it out
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, here we go
One, two, three
[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
[Verse 2]
I'm looking straight ahead into the unknown
I'm not afraid
This ride has just begun
I'll take the highs and lows
So bring it on
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, here we go
One, two, three
[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
All the way
[Bridge]
Sometimes life's a roller coaster
Takes you up-up-up
And then it spins you 'round
So throw your hands up in the air
And go all (go all out)
Make it count (1, 2, 3)
[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow (I'm ready for tomorrow)
There ain't a map to follow (There ain't a map to follow)
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
All the way
