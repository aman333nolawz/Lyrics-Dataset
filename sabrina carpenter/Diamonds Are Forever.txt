[Verse 1]
Think you got your break?
I'm no sugar mama, I'm no piggy bank
Tell me what you think, nah, nah, nah
Stacking bills and counting change
I'm no Rockefeller, I'm not what you think, no way, nah, nah, nah
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm your new money
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon, money
One percent, I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth
[Chorus]
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever, oh no, no
[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
[Verse 2]
Steal my heart and steal my kiss
But you can't check my balances, no can do, nah, nah, nah
No can do no, nah, nah, nah
And I'll take you out, and I'll take you in
This love is my weakness, nah, nah
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm your new money (new money)
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon, money
One percent, I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth
[Chorus]
I am a diamond (diamond babe), and diamonds are forever (oh, they're forever-ever)
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever
[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class (don't buy class, nah, nah)
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever, oh nah, nah, nah
[Break]
(Diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Diamonds are forever, baby
(Diamonds, diamonds)
What you gonna do for me, darling?
(Diamonds, diamonds)
I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you
[Chorus]
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever
They're forever, no, you know
[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
[Post-Chorus]
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Diamonds, baby, diamonds, no, no
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Know your love, these diamonds are yours
(Diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)
I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you
