[Verse 1]
Said there's nothing that we can't do when we're dancing
I can feel the music more when I'm with you
With your hands on me, I feel my heartbeat racing
Now
[Pre-Chorus]
Had to let go of everything that I've known
Before, 'ore, 'ore
[Chorus]
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
One, two, three, and dance with me tonight (Tonight)
And maybe all our dreams are coming true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you (Nah)
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
Said one, two, three, and dance with me tonight (Tonight)
And maybe all our dreams are coming true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you, let me move you
[Verse 2]
Yeah, little faster, little slower, it don't matter
'Cause I've never known myself this good 'til now
And I hope you know it's changing me forever
Forever
[Pre-Chorus]
Had to let go of everything that I've known
Before, 'ore, 'ore (Baby)
[Chorus]
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
One, two, three, and dance with me tonight (Tonight)
And maybe all our dreams are coming true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you (Nah)
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
Said one, two, three, and dance with me tonight (Tonight)
And maybe all our dreams are coming true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you, let me move you
