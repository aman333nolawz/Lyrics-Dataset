[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Waking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why
[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose
[Pre-Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why
[Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time
[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times
