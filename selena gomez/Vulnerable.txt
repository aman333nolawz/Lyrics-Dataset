[Verse 1]
If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it? Would you grow it?
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?
[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable
[Verse 2]
If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it?
(Would you even wanna take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it, would you wanna make it?)
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it? (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable
[Non-Lyrical Vocal Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Outro]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I'll stay vulnerable
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
I'll stay vulnerable
