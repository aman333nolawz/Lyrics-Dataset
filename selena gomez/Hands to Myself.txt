[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what itâ€™s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of the downs and the uppers

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the downs and the uppers

Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else

I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?
[Chorus]
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
