[Intro: Ozuna]
Wo-oh, oh-oh
[Chorus: Ozuna]
Dance as if it were the last time (Oh)
And show me that little step that I don't know (Yeah-yeah)
A very soft little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki, rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
Hi Music Hi Flow (Snake; haha)
Dance as if it were the last time (Oh-oh)
And show me that little step that I don't know (Oh-oh)
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki (Oh-oh)
Taki taki (Yeah-yeah)
[Verse 1: Ozuna]
Taki Taki
Do you want a little kiss or a ñaqui
Booty blows up like Nagasaki (-Aki)
Turn on the Kawasaki motorcycles (Kawasaki)
That the club is full and the Annunaki are here (Eh-eh)
Don't slow down, the booty sticks out of your outfit
She didn't bring panties so the guy doesn't have to work for it
It's just that I know what she thinks she knows
She says she doesn't want to but she is spying on me, eh-eh
The booty sticks out of your outfit
She didn't bring panties so the guy doesn't have to work for it
It's just that I know what she thinks she knows
She says she doesn't want to but she is spying on me, eh-eh
[Chorus: Ozuna]
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I don't know
A very soft little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki, rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Bardi (Cardi)
He said he wants to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
While my piggybank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know this punani is undefeated, ayy
He said he really wanna see me more
I said, "We should have a date—where? At the Lamborghini store"
I'm kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a ouija board
But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I'll be talkin 'cash shit while I'm poppin' my gold grill (Uh)
I'ma whole rich bitch but I work like I'm broke still (Cardi)
But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real (Uh)
[Bridge: Cardi B]
The booty sticks out of my outfit
I didn't wear panties so he doesn't have to work for it
It's just that I know what you think you don't know
He says he doesn't want to but he wants to eat this package
[Chorus: Ozuna]
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I don't know
A very soft little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki, rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 3: Selena Gomez]
DJ Snake
Careful when you come through my way
My body-ody know how to play
Work it, keep it tight every day
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooh, falling in love
Give a little ooh-ooh, get it well done
Dancing in my ooh, make a girl wanna run
We keep moving 'til the sun come up
Because I am the party, I am party
Blow out your candles, have a nap
You can try but not one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, yeah my taki taki gets, uh
[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Ozuna]
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I don't know
A very soft little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki, rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
Hi Music Hi Flow
Taki taki
Taki taki
