[Intro]
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever said "Goodbye"
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever left my side
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
[Verse 1]
You're the only hand in my back pocket
If you ever left, I'd go psychotic
Heaven, hear me cryin', cryin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, you're the key to my heart, lock it
If you ever left, never unlock it
Lonely like an island, island (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (But yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (But yours)
[Refrain]
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever said "Goodbye"
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever left my side
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
[Verse 2]
You're the only hand in my back pocket
If you ever left, I'd go psychotic
Heaven hear me cryin', cryin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hit me like a drug and I can't stop it
Fit me like a glove and I can't knock it
I ain't even lyin', lyin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (Nobody's, but yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (But yours)
[Post-Chorus]
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody's love
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody's love
Nobody's love
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (No, no, but yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (No, no, no, no, but yours)
[Post-Chorus]
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody's love
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody's love
