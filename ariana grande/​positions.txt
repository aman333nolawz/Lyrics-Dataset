[Verse 1]
Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history
[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No), no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be
[Chorus]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you
[Verse 2]
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you (With you)
[Pre-Chorus]
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No), no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be
[Chorus]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (Nothin')
That I won't do, switchin' for you
[Bridge]
This some shit that I usually don't do (Yeah)
But for you, I kinda, kinda want to (Mmm)
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too (And I'm down too)
Yeah, I'm down too
Switchin' the positions for you
This some shit that I (Yeah) usually don't do (Don't do)
But for you, I kinda, kinda want to (Mmm)
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too ('Cause you're down for me)
[Chorus]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops (Jumpin', jumpin')
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you (Ooh woah)
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
That I won't do, switchin' for you
[Outro]
Yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah (Ah), yeah
