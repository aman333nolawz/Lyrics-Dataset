[Verse 1]
It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
[Verse 2]
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
[Bridge]
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away
[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah
