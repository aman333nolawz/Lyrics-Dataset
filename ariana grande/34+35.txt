[Intro]
Hmm
[Verse 1]
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right" (Yeah)
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you up (You up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up)
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee (I've been drinkin' coffee; coffee)
And I've been eatin' healthy (I've been eatin' healthy; healthy)
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (You know I keep it squeaky)
Savin' up my energy (Yeah, yeah, savin' up my energy)
[Chorus]
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck mе 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
You drink it just like water (Water)
You say it tastes like candy
So what you doin' tonight? (Tonight)
Better say, "Doin' you right" (Alright)
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you up (You up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up)

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, you might need a seatbelt when I ride it
I'ma leave it open like a door, come inside it
Even though I'm wifey, you can hit it like a side chick
Don't need no side dick, no
Got the neighbors yellin' "Earthquake!" (Earthquake)
4.5 when I make the bed shake
Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight (It's lightweight, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe)
Yeah, we started at midnight
Go 'til the sunrise (Sunrise)
Done at the same time (Yeah)
But who's counting the time when we got it for life? (Got it for life)
I know all your favorite spots (Favorite spots)
We can take it from the top (From the top)
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh
[Chorus]
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Thirty-four, thirty-five)
Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that means?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Do you know what that means?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
