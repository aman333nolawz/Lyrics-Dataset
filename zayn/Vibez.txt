[Chorus]
Don't keep me waitin' (Ooh, ooh)
I been waitin' all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for ya (Ooh, ooh)
You know the vibes, know the vibes
Put it on ya (Ooh)
If we're movin' too fast, we can slow up
Baby, this far from mediocre (No)
You know the vibes, know the vibes
[Verse]
It's you and me here in this room
Imaginin' things we could do
Won't tell no lies, no lies to you
I need you here, I need you here
Mind runnin' wild, we touchin' slow
Just say the word, I'm ready to go, oh
Anticipation plays after four
I need you now
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma get you right, I will (I will)
When I touch you, tell me how it feel (It feel)
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, mind of mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Get you right where you need to be (Ooh, ooh)
Just don't keep me
[Chorus]
Don't keep me waitin' (Ooh, ooh)
I been waitin' all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for ya (Ooh, ooh)
You know the vibes, know the vibes
Put it on ya
If we're movin' too fast, we could slow up (Too fast)
Baby, this far from mediocre (No)
You got the vibes, got the vibes (Mmm)
[Bridge]
If I'm movin' too fast, too fast
Oh, oh-oh, mmm (Ooh, ooh), mmm, oh (Ooh, ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma get you right, I will (I will)
When I touch you, tell me how it feel (It feel)
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, mind of mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Get you right where you need to be (Ooh, ooh)
Just don't keep me (Don't keep me waitin')
[Chorus]
Don't keep me waitin'
I been waitin' all night to get closer
Yeah, you already know I got it for ya (Ooh)
You know the vibes, know the vibes (Vibes)
Put it on ya (Ooh)
If we're movin' too fast, we could slow up
Baby, this far from mediocre (No)
You got the vibes, got the vibes
