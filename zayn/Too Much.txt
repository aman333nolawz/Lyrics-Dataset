[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I think we met and the time flies
I took your digits a while back
I think we fucked in the flashback
Won't leave my mind, kinda sidetracked
Felt good but now I feel bad
I think I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say
[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keepin' me up night and day
Keepin' me up night and day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothin' I can say but
[Chorus: ZAYN & Timbaland]
I guess I want too much (Too much)
I just want love and lust (Uh)
You just can't love enough (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Uh)
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Wiki)
[Verse 2: ZAYN]
I never meant to, but I did though
I gotta keep it on the d-low
Then again, what the fuck do I know?
You're always on my mind so
Felt good but now I feel bad
I think I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say
[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keepin' me up night and day
Keepin' me up night and day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothin' I can say but
[Chorus: ZAYN & Timbaland]
I guess I want too much (Too much)
I just want love and lust (Uh)
You just can't love enough (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Uh)
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Wiki)
[Bridge: ZAYN]
When the room becomes a game we play
White lines, they seem to turn to snakes
I guess I'll turn you 'way
Say white lies to your face
You know I know my place
Nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can say
[Chorus: ZAYN & Timbaland]
I guess I want too much (Too much)
I just want love and lust (Uh)
You just can't love enough (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Uh)
That's why I need a touch (Yeah)
That's why I need a touch (Wiki)
