[Intro]
Only you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry
[Verse 1]
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on
Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
[Verse 2]
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now
That's why I went to war
Oh yeah, you are my sober
When I'm on the floor
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
[Bridge]
Need you when I'm hot and when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far
[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
[Outro]
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm
Need you when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you are
