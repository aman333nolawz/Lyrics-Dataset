[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Two wrongs make no right
When it's left, at least, we tried (Oh)
I'll be back tonight (Oh, yeah)
I'll let you decide
[Chorus]
To leave my life outside
Leave my life outside
Leave my life outside
Or let me in, or let me in
[Verse 1]
I know I'm always in my head
Some things, they must be said
Hurts me when I think about it
Someone else being in your bed
I know I'm not so innocent
But the love I had for you was real
Hope it hurts you when you think about it
The both of us just have to dip
[Refrain]
T-shirt that you're wearing, that's my favorite
First time that I touched you, you could save it
[Pre-Chorus]
Two wrongs make no right
When it's left, at least, we tried (Oh)
I'll be back tonight (Oh, yeah)
I'll let you decide
[Chorus]
To leave my life outside
Leave my life outside
Leave my life outside
Or let me in, or let me in
[Verse 2]
It wasn't all bad, now, was it?
All the things that we've been through
The way you snuck out of your parents'
Just you and me up on the roof
We didn't have much, but, yeah, we did it
Staring at the perfect view
Do I keep the dog or do you want him?
When I look at him, I think of you
[Refrain]
The T-shirt that you're wearing, that's my favorite
Damn, I really thought that we would make it, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Two wrongs make no right
When it's left, at least, we tried (At least, we tried)
I'll be back tonight (I'll be back)
I'll let you decide
[Chorus]
So leave my shit outside
Leave all of my shit outside
Leave my life outside
Oh-oh, or let me in
