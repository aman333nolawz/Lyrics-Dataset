[Verse 1: Wrabel]
You, you're givin' me life
Givin' me all of you, mmm
Oh, it's true
Losin' myself, I found me right next you, oh yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel]
You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah
[Chorus: Wrabel]
Whoa oh, I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
It's my ritual
[Post-Chorus - Instrumental: Wrabel]
(It's my ritual)
(Now that I've found you)
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
My ritual
[Verse 2: Wrabel]
You, first thing on my mind when I'm waking up is you, oh yeah
When I'm blue, you spin me around the color wheel
Yes, you do, oh yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel]
You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah
[Chorus: Wrabel]
Whoa oh, I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
It's my ritual
[Post-Chorus: Wrabel]
(Now that I've found you)
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
(It's my ritual)
[Outro: Wrabel]
Say you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm lost without my ritual
