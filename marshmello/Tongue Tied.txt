[Intro: YUNGBLUD]
I feel my life's been so tongue-tied
I'm trapped outside, inside my mind
If you feel like, that you're tongue-tied
Then we're tongue-tied together
[Verse 1: YUNGBLUD]
Every morning, I ride on a carousel
To the sides of my mind that I cannot help
Had to die in Heaven just to get to Hell
Fell when the lights went out now
My real friends act like they don't know me
This headache's giving me a nosebleed
My silence is killing me slowly
I can't keep tuning it out and
[Pre-Chorus: YUNGBLUD]
I been suffering
Been makin' friends with all my sins
I need savin', I need savin'
You won't save me ever again
I'm feeling counterfeit
Been rolling silence 'round my lips
I need savin', I need savin'
You won't save me ever again
[Chorus: YUNGBLUD]
'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue-tied
I'm trapped outside, inside my mind
If you feel like, that you're tongue-tied
Then we're tongue-tied together
So can you even hear me now?
[Post-Chorus: YUNGBLUD & blackbear]
Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together
Yeah yeah, uh-uh
[Verse 2: blackbear]
You done changed, you done changed, you done switched up for sure
You ain't lose me in the summer, you lost me at "Hello"
Anytime you see me smilin', it was probably for show
All the memories are blurry, so I let 'em burn slow
I ain't seen you in a minute, where did all the time go?
You was outta pocket when you told me "Die slow"
I was going through the shits, I kept it down low
Tongue-tied, tongue-tied, what we had was all lies
[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me ever again
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me
[Chorus: YUNGBLUD, blackbear, both]
'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue-tied
I'm trapped outside, inside my mind (Inside my mind)
If you feel like (You feel like), that you're tongue-tied (Uh)
Then we're tongue-tied together
So can you even hear me now?
[Post-Chorus: YUNGBLUD]
Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together
So can you even hear me now?
Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together (Oh)
