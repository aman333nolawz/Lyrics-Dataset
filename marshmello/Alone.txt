[Verse]
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse]
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
[Instrumental Break]
