[Verse 1]
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust
[Verse 2]
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love
[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust
