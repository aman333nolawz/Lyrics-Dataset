[Verse 1]
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
[Verse 2]
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
[Verse 3]
There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
[Bridge]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
[Verse 4]
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love
[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
[Outro]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
