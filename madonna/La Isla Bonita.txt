[Intro]
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast
[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Te dijo, te amo
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Él dijo que te ama
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
La isla bonita
(Spanish lullaby)
