[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna
[Verse 1: Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, ah
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
(Fikki fikki, fikki fikki, come on)
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want
[Chorus: Madonna, Justin Timberlake ]
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy, then grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes
[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Both]
So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
[Verse 2: Madonna, Justin Timberlake]
Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake, (Timbaland)]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want (Come on)
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want
[Chorus: Madonna, Justin Timberlake ]
The time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy, then grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes
[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Both]
So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
[Outro: Timbaland, Madonna]
Breakdown, yeah
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
Yeah, uh
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
I only got four minutes, to save the world
