[Verse 1]
Soft glow on the city
She said, "There's no one here who can touch you now"
Caught the last flight out of LAX
With your one-way ticket, New York-bound
[Pre-Chorus]
Climb so high, don't make a sound
Don't you forget what goes up must come down
Climb so high, tell me how it feels
[Chorus]
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, hallelujah
Makes no difference here, so let's be real
Black Madonna, my black flower
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
You're not havin' fun, I think that you should ride
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, my hallelujah
[Verse 2]
On the phone you sound shifty
You say that you're at home, alone right now
But in the background there's a muffled laugh
As you spin that wool and pull it down
[Pre-Chorus]
Climb so high, don't hear a sound
Don't you forget what goes around, comes around
Climb so high, tell me how to feel
[Chorus]
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, hallelujah
Makes no difference here, so let's be real
Black Madonna, my black flower
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
Says it should be gone, at least it was this time
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, my hallelujah
[Chorus]
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, hallelujah
Makes no difference here, so let's be real
Black Madonna, my black flower
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
You're not havin' fun, I think that you should ride
Call me when you're ready to be real
Black Madonna, my hallelujah
