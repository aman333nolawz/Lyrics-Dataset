There’s a continuous knocking on the doors

Come now with Your arms wide open

[Bridge]
The neem plant is green in colour
And so is the shrub of betel
Don’t refuse me, my Lord
Please come and rest in my home
I cannot stay at Your place
As Goddess Sita is waiting for me at home
Goddess Sita is alone
And she is waiting for her Lord Ram and his brother Lord Lakshman
[Verse 2]
The moments are passing by
Come now, dance with me
Your hands are shivering
Don’t be scared anymore
[Chorus 3]
In the gardens, it sings
The peacock sings and tells all about the state of the heart
[Hook]
The nagāṛā and ḍhōla drums are beating, the ḍhōla drums are beating
Dhānya dhānya dhama dhama dhānya
The nagāṛā and ḍhōla drums are beating, the ḍhōla drums are beating
Dhānya dhānya dhānya dhama dhānya

Hē, dhina taṛāka, dhina taṛāka
Come flying at a rapid speed and unlock the shackles off my feet

The nagāṛā and ḍhōla drums are beating, the ḍhōla drums are beating
Dhānya dhānya dhama dhama dhānya
The nagāṛā and ḍhōla drums are beating, the ḍhōla drums are beating
Dhānya dhānya dhānya dhama dhānya
[Bridge]
The neem plant is green in colour
And so is the shrub of betel
Don’t refuse me, my Lord
Please come and rest in my home
I cannot stay at Your place
As Goddess Sita is waiting for me at home
Goddess Sita is alone
And she is waiting for her Lord Ram and his brother Lord Lakshman
[Outro]
Hē.... The ḍhōla drums are beating!
