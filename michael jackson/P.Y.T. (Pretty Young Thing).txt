[Intro]
You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., Pretty Young Thing, ooh
[Verse 1]
Where did you come from lady?
And ooh won't you take me there
Right away won't you baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar fly with me
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the loving pain
Let me take you to the max
[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, girl, ooh-oh
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
(Anywhere you want to go)
Yes, I will, ooh
[Verse 2]
Nothing can stop this burning desire to be with you
Got to get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearning
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights, just to make it right
In the night, hit the loving spot
I'll give you all that I've got
[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, yes, I will, yes, I will
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Yes, I will, hee-eh
[Bridge]
Pretty young thing, UH!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young thing, UH!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young things, repeat after me
Sing, "na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
"Na-na-na-na" (Na-na-na-na)
Sing, "na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
"Na-na-na-na" (Na-na-na-na)
I will take you there, take you there
[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, take you there, take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, take you there, hoo-ooh
[Outro]
Hoo-ooh! (I want to love, you P.Y.T., P.Y.T.)
Oh, baby (I want to give, you T.L.C., T.L.C)
Oh, baby
Hold on, ooh-ooh
I want to love, you P.Y.T., P.Y.T
I want to give, you T.L.C., T.L.C
You're such a P.Y.T. to me, pretty young thing
Oh baby, oh baby, hold on
I want to love, you P.Y.T., P.Y.T. (oh, baby)
I want to give, you T.L.C., T.L.C (you can be, ooh)
I just wanna love you, you know?
Ha-ha-ha, I'll give you all that I got
