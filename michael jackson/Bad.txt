[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right, ah
Just show your face in broad daylight, ah
I'm tellin' you on how I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, ah, shamone
Lay it on me, ah, all right
Ah, I'm givin' you on count of three, ah
Just show your stuff or let it be, ah
I'm tellin' you, just watch your mouth, ah
I know your game, what you're about
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me, that's really true, ah
But my friend, you have say nothing
Just wait 'til I get through!
[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad! Shamone! (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad! Shamone! (Bad, bad)
You know! (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doin' wrong, ah
Gonna lock you up before too long, ah
Your lyin' eyes gon'na tell you right (ah ah)
So listen up, don't make a fight (ah ah)
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man, ah
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me, that's really true, ah
But my friend, you have say nothing
Just wait 'til I get through!
[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad! Shamone! (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad! You know it! (Bad, bad)
You know! (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
[Organ Solo]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place, ah
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face?!
[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad! Shamone! (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it, you know! (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now (Hoo! Hoo!)
Just to tell you once again (Hoo!)

You know, you know! (Bad, bad)
You know, shamone! (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm smooth, I'm bad, you know it! (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
Come on! (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now (Hoo!)
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it! (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
