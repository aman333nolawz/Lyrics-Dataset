[Skit]
Hey!

Turn it off!

It’s too late for this, turn it off!
Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!
No, this is the, I want to listen to it, okay?
You’ve got things to do tomorrow
Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this
[Intro]
Aaow!
Aaow!
[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!
[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!
[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
[Outro]
Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah)
