[Spoken Intro]
You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah
It make me feel like… ooh!
[Verse 1]
Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power is the force, the vow (Oh power)
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why (Ooh)
So get closer (Closer now)
To my body now
Just love me
'Till you don't know how (Ooh)
[Chorus]
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
[Verse 2]
Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain’t nothin' like a love desire (Ooh)
I'm melting (I'm melting)
Like hot candle wax
Sensation (Oh sensation)
Lovely where we're at (Ooh!)
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin' (Aah)
'Cause this is love power (Ooh)
