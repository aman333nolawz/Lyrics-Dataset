"why you want to be in my life now
I'm tired of you playing with my heart
Its not a toy,you wanna talk shit now
Oh boy
Watch how you talk to me
You fuck boy
You fucking used me
But every night i ask myself
How could this be
Why this bull shit i never could see
You call yourself my father
But no ...leave me be
Nahh i ain't tryna be mean
I'm tired of loving someone
But physically there's no one
I feel lost
Like a lost cause
I don't owe you no fucking because
Wheres mine
When you walked out on me
Did you ever care to see if i was okay
Nahhh dont say hi
Cuz you dead to me now
So goodbye
(hook)
"its funny how we pretend, like everything never happened
But it did
And this is it
You now don't mean shit
Like i did to you
Screw you"
I was the pretty girl
With a broken soul
Once couldn't take no more
So i tried to end it
But i'm not
Cuz i'm not a lost cause
My mind became my enemy
All i could say is try me
I'm not that too nice rihana you once knew
Naw that side of me is threw
You brought this side of me out
So just get the fuck out my mind
Cuz your so called wise words
Is making me run out of time
Not from you i ever need a dime
I will work hard for whats truly mine
(hook)
"its funny how we pretend like nothing ever happened
But it did
You now don't mean shit
Like i did to you
Screw you"
But imma regret you leaving me
When you see them millions coming in
Your gonna again try to knock in my heart and try to come in
Naw nigga where was you in my struggling phase
Fuck dat shit
Your weak ass to me now
Don't mean shit to me now
So don't try anymore
Cuz yeah i don't love u anymore
Take that to heart
Naw shut da fuck up
Don't even start
