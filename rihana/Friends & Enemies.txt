Yeah yeah
Don't burn no bridges

[Chorus: Akaey & Pacii]
Money turned my friends into my enemies
Families turned on me  it was sad to see
Money turned my fitness into my enemies
Families turned on me it was sad to see
Now this pain up on my shoulder is eased
With Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy

[Verse I: Losart]
Got a lot of energy

Haters only envy me
Cause I be the realest
This bitch keep on messaging

Got a bitch named stephani
Coca yea she need it

But I don't really drink it
All I smoke is plenty green
Greenest of the greenest
I don't got no limits
I don't got no ceilings
Getting all this money it's my expertise
Ex calling me cause I'm a better me
Had to turn my bitch into a memory
Pull up and I know that they'll remember me
[Chorus: Akaey & Pacii]
Money turned my friends into my enemies
Families turned on me  it was sad to see

[Verse II: Akaey]
You’re far from a friend of mine
Your hatred is hard to hide
Said that you was down to ride
Then you turned on me i don’t know
If it was money or the fame see y’all don’t show
No love when i come around
Only thing that’s truly down
Is my Hennessy yeah
Guidance from the mighty above
I need it all like everyday
Pour it up and drink some
And watch all the pain fade away
I put in work like who you sleeping on
Henny what I’m sipping on
Rainy days don’t do me none
Grateful for my fuckin clique
Blood thicker than water but the end they all leak
[Chorus: Akaey & Pacii]
Money turned my friends into my enemies
Families turned on me  it was sad to see
Money turned my fitness into my enemies
Families turned on me it was sad to see
Now this pain up on my shoulder is eased
With Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy
Just me and my Hennessy yeah
[Verse III: Pacii]
I got blood that ain't family
I got family that ain't blood
Ask Akaey he was there with me
And we made it through the mud
Yo
I got blood that ain't family
Yo real talk tho
I got family that ain't blood
We did it bro
Ask Akaey he was there with me
And we made it through the mud
We here
And we made it through the mud
We here
Sipping off this henny bottle
Cause our feelings staying bottled
Fuck today live for tomorrow
We just off this Hennessy
Niggas showing jealousy
We just off this Hennessy
Tryna make a legacy
Bad bitch in the section
Show her right to my direction
Body like Rihana shorty looking like perfection
I done did my dirt but shorty ain’t nobody perfect
I done took some  L’s I’m bouncing back but they know that
