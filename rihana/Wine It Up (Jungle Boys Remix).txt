[Verse 2: odG]
Hey baby start with me, I'm really getting tense when you move slowly
I'm tryna get myself lucky, I hope your fine body come push up on me
Please don't stop your company, your personality and thighs got me hooked totally, yeah
I pursue cautiously before the other thirsty homies take you off of me
I saw you on the floor and I thought I gotta go
To get my trophy with her body yo
Her body playin' tricks it pulls me closer yo
I feel her heartbeat pumping just like, "bum pee dum"
I have been feeling them jeans
I like the way you move it, girl you so sexy
Please don't test me, I'll mess your life around and leave you so happy
Oh, baby in my head I'm thinkin' drop it, drop it, drop it, fulfil my dreams
Baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, join me like a team
Baby come on fakha, fakha, fakha, follow my routine, baby
And just love me, love me, love me
So baby when you join me I'm gonna make you satisfied
You'll want me and you'll think you are my bride
Her games tell my brain to go take her side
So she can get a strong horse for her to ride
[Chorus: Bxbyboy]
Yo, she wine it up (wine it!)
Rihana work (Rihana work!)
Ina your pumpum, girl I fuck it up (fuck it!)
She bust it up (bust it!)

Yo, she wine it up (wine it!)

Ina your pumpum, girl I fuck it up (fuck it!)
She bust it up (bust it!)
Dumper truck (dumper truck!)
I got banana baby, come and eat it up
