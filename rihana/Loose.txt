Get G-get Get Loose Now
[Verse 1]
Benny BOOM! Turn the bass up louder
'Til every single titty jiggle harder
She a hoochie watch the mini skirt ride up
Dimes and pennies twerk, get it hotter
Hoochies want to get on the guest list
Eat a small dinner so you fit in your dresses
Fuck a meal, go for mills
Big breast get treated like guest
I'm serving dick for breakfast, pussy pop
She like three things: The club, money, sex, yes!
Just like hip hop, did a full strut when we pulled up
She said she like D's, I said Deeeez nuts!
Ain't that what you want, a Hilton ain't a Trump
Make sex tapes get dicked, get dumped
All this money make a bitch go dumb
Coke on the tip will make a bitch go numb
[Hook]
She ain't nothing but a hoochie mamma
She ain't nothing but a hoochie mamma
She ain't nothing but a hoochie mamma
Hood rat, hood rat a hoochie mamma
Get Get Get Loose Now
Get Get Get Loose Now
Get Get Get Loose Now
Get Get Get Loose Now
[Verse 2]
Go head and get it nigga, you know you want it nigga
She solid gold nigga, Anna Nicole nigga
I'm about to show this glorified ho
How my hip hop dick head bang like rock and roll nigga
She got to have it cinematic like netflix
HD documented pearl drop necklace
She going to call herself a classy bitch
Live in Chelsea but her naughty parts the meat pack district
Got milk duds, face like Rihana
Got me popping retro fashion
That make me want to cash in, smashing
Trim bush like Shirley last season
What's happenin' Roj!
A prima donna in her Dolce and Gabbana
You can find her well travel from Nicaragua to Ghana
Up front, You bait her right and she going to bite like a piranha
Cause she, she ain't nothing but a hoochie mamma
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Oh n-n-no, hold up I got some shit to say
Cause all these copy catting bitches copy me all day
Call me out my name why don't you come around my way
I got my cousin baby mother and a brother on the way
Fake bitches want to be this chick but they not
I don't lay on my back for tracks or sleep my way to the top
Sex ain't for beats or backstage passes, girl keep working that ass
You smarter than I thought you got your heart on my man assets
Oh no I cash his checks let's not forget and I fuck to bust nuts
Fuck a mans respect, I rap for money to spend to keep my panties wet
And just to keep bitches mad I keep bitches in check
Laying yourself in dirty sheets like hooker on the street
Rocking your coochie like that Gucci that you bought up the street
I got mad styles for days your styles been played
And I every thing you rock today I did yesterday
Now girls I met they wanna fight me, talking shit just tryin' to spite me
Walk it off I top it off, wow you hood rats trying to bite me
You have him? I been at him, girl I own that ass
Little heffer hoochie momma please, you ain't bad!
[Hook]
Uhuh, See thats why I don't like ya'll bitches anyway
Always up on my motherfucking man
Trying to be cute
You ain't cute
Shit, bitch is nasty
Ya'll bitchs is nas-ty
