[Verse 1]
I've been looking through my memories
I've been tryna see your face
(I've been tryna see your face)
But you're moving like mystery
And you look the other way
If you found me in the pouring rain
Would you let me in?
Would you look into your memories?
Tell me where you've been
[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun is going down
I feel you comin' closer
Counting in the dark, I feel at home (Home, home)
[Chorus]
I see you light up the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
I see the stars in your eyes
Believe in your lies, aurora
Mine for a moment and then you're gone
'Cause I'm still holding on
To a light in the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
[Verse 2]
Feeling almost like a secret?
Hidden in an emerald sea
And I'm drowning in your green eyes
Got that power over me
If I told you how I really feel
Would you let me in?
Could you tell me all your secrets?
Tell me where you've been
[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun is going down
I feel you comin' closer
Counting in the dark, I feel at home (Home, home)
[Chorus]
I see you light up the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
I see the stars in your eyes
Believe in your lies, aurora
Mine for a moment and then you're gone
'Cause I'm still holding on
To a light in the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
[Outro]
I see you light up the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
I see the stars in your eyes
Believe in your lies, aurora
Mine for a moment and then you're gone
'Cause I'm still holding on
To a light in the sky
A dance in the night, aurora
