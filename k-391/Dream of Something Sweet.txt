[Chorus]
Sleep till I come home
Dream of something sweet
I will be there soon
To wake you so discrete
[Drop]
[Chorus]
Sleep till I come home
Dream of something sweet
I will be there soon
To wake you so discrete
[Post-Chorus]
Window, sky, the sun
Toss your madness through
To wake you so discrete
Window, sky, the sun
Toss your madness through
