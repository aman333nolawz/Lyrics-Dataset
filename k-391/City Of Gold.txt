[Verse 1: Anna Yvette]
Legends and lullabies
Are songs we sing to the stars in the sky
Kings and queens
Treasures untold
Whispers of streets that are paved in gold
[Pre-Chorus]
City of gold, city of gold (gold)
City of gold
[Chorus: Anna Yvette]
Lead me down the road
City of gold
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
Shine like the sun, you are the one
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
City of gold, city of gold
[Verse 2: Anna Yvette]
Eagles soar forever more
A golden sea
On a golden shore
Fairytales and rainbows
Whispers of streets that are paved in gold
[Pre-Chorus]
City of gold, city of gold (gold)
City of gold
[Chorus: Anna Yvette]
Lead me down the road
City of gold
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
Shine like the sun, you are the one
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
City of gold, city of gold
[Chorus: Anna Yvette]
Lead me down the road
City of gold
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
Shine like the sun, you are the one
Wishes come true whenever I'm with you
City of gold, city of gold
