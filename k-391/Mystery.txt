[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
You're my one love, ey
[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
The mysteries of your sweet love
They woke me up
And saved my soul
I used to be so immature
You made me grow
And brought me home
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Now everything’s right, right, right
There's something inside of me, I'm coming alive
With you and me side by side
Like we’re two of the same
And it's like, like, like
I'm looking at life through your wonderful eyes
I'm feeling the high and I'm loving the ride
Cause you're coming along
[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
My love
You are the only one
You're where it all comes from
You are my soul and sun
You are the only one
My love
You are the only one
You made it beautiful
I want you to know
You are the only one
[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I look in your eyes as they close
And watch you sleep
Here next to me
Your tiny fingers pull me close
And now I know
Unconditional (love)
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Now everything's right, right, right
There’s something inside of me, I’m coming alive
With you and me side by side
Like we're two of the same
And it’s like, like, like
I'm looking at life through your wonderful eyes
I'm feeling the high and I'm loving the ride
Cause you’re coming along
[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
My love
You are the only one
You're where it all comes from
You are my soul and sun
You are the only one
My love
You are the only one
You made it beautiful
I want you to know
You are the only one
One love, baby, you're my one love (Je t'aime)
One love, baby, you're my one love (Je t'aime)
One love, baby, you're my one love
[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Let them know it's an honor and I look forward to it, you know
Like Michael Jackson would say: “thank you for keeping me young”
One love!
One love, baby, you're my one love (Je t'aime)
One love, baby, you're my one love (Je t'aime)
One love, baby, you're my one love
O-o-o-o-o-ooh
[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
My love
You are the only one
You're where it all comes from
You are my soul and sun
You are the only one
My love
You are the only one
You made it beautiful
I want you to know
You are the only one
