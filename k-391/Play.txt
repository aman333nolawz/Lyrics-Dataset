[Verse 1]
We used to hide under the covers
Serenade each other
With careless melodies
Something buried deep inside us
The major and the minor
We're like piano keys
[Chorus]
You played for me
You played for me, Oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
[Drop]
You played for me
You played for me
You played for me
[Verse 2]
We couldn't stop the world from turning
It was like a whirlwind
Scattered us like leaves
But I'm stuck inside a feeling
The song that never leaves
We were like a symphony
[Chorus]
You played for me
You played for me, Oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
[Drop]
You played for me
You played for me
You played for me
[Bridge]
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You played for me
[Outro]
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me
