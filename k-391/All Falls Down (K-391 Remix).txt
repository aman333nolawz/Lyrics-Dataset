[Verse 1:]
What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
U crossed the line
& it's time to say f-u!
[Verse 2:]
What’s the point in saying that
When u know how I’ll react
U think u can just take it back
But shit just don’t work like that
You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I’m stuck
With you
And that’s that
[Chorus:]
Cus when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don’t work out for the better
If we just ain’t right and it’s time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine
You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I’ll be fine
[Verse 3:]
Why we fight, I don’t know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
Staying cold
But you take it personal
All this firing shots
And making grounder
It’s way too hard to cope
But I still
Can’t let
You go
[outro:]
All Falls Down
All Falls Down
All Falls Down
All Falls Down
