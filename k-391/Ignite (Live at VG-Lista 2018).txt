[Verse 1: Julie Bergan]
Fireflies, a million little pieces
Feeds the dying light, and breathes me back to life
In your eyes, I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame
Your palms the sweetest pain
[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan & Vinni]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie (yeah, yeah, yeah)
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
[Verse 2: Julie Bergan]
So alive, your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin, it turns me on again
You and I, survivors of the same kind
And we're the only ones
Dancing on the sun
[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
[Bridge: Vinni]
Yeah, [?]
Getting lost in the [?]
Hold the two close, get close to the [?]
Six-part [?], two parts [?]
Call it what you want, all she wanted was a soldier
Yeah!
[Scream?] a little louder, [?]
[?] chemicals in our mind
And we gonna, we gonna win
[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
