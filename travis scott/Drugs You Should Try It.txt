[Intro]
(Hooo) yawa thgin eht esahc
Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I
Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
[Chorus]
I try it if it feels right
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Hooo) yawa thgin eht esahc
Ot ydaer 'nitteg erâ€™uoy wonk I
Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I
Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
[Verse]
We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat' above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose
[Chorus]
I try it if it feels right (Oh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Hooo) yawa thgin eht esahc
Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I
Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
[Bridge]
Shit, I try it if it feels nice
Shit, this kinda feels nice
M-miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
[Outro]
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you gettin' ready to
Take the night away
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you're gettin' ready to
Chase the night away (Oooh)
Oh, you love me, darling
