[Part 1]
[Intro: Travis Scott, Kacy Hill & Chantel Jeffries]
(Dean, what's poppin'? Yo, Travis)
Mhm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mama's bailing down that road, craving 9021...
[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Chantel Jeffries]
She a porn star girl, ah, from the valley
(Honestly, God bless)
Who left her hometown world all for that alley
Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
(I hope it was wet like my jumper, though)
Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy, mm (Hahaha)
[Chorus: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling low
Do, do, do
Do, doo
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Jacques turned La Flame, now he rolling on an Addy
Fifty on a chain, 'nother fifty on a Caddy, oh
He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone
Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley
Hmm, yeah, to find that alley, mm
[Chorus: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling low
Do, do, do
Do, doo
[Bridge: Travis Scott & Kacy Hill]
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley
Baby's hooked on feeling low
In the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley
[Part 2]
[Interlude: Travis Scott]
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Yeah
My granny called, she said, "Travie, you work too hard
I'm worried you forget about me"
I'm falling in and out of clouds, don't worry, I'ma get it, Granny, uh
What happened? Now my daddy happy
Mama called me up, that money coming and she love me
I done made it now, I done found life's meaning now
All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
Friends turning into fraud niggas
Practicing half the passion, you niggas packaged different
All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it
I'ma sell it, you niggas salad, we 'bout the cabbage
Youngest nigga out of Houston at the Grammys
Smiling at 'em laughing at me
I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked then passed it back, bitch
All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin, yeah, yeah
Mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the stu', yeah, we 'bout to drop a four
He passed the cigarette, I choke, woo
Told my auntie put them 'Ports down, them 'Ports down
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky, from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter so now a nigga support a nigga
