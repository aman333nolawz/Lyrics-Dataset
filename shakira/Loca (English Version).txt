[Intro]
Loca (Loca)
Loca
Dance or die
Loca (Loca)
[Verse 1: Shakira]
She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, "Ahh!" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up
[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it
[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica Caliente, got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good, and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Ay, papi"
[Chorus: Shakira, El Cata]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it (Loca, loca, loca)
[Interlude]
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki
[Verse 3: Shakira, Dizzee Rascal & El Cata]
I guess she doesn't know the things that I’d do to please you
I take you to the malecón por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause, we’re dancin' Mambo, oh, what she don't allow it?
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hit the- ooh!
And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me, they're running out of in the market
(Shhh)
[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it
[Pe-Chorus: Shakira & Dizzee Rascal]
¡Dios mío!
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)
It's a madness
Pure madness
Loca
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)
[Interlude]
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki
[Chorus / Outro]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
(Ca, loca-ca, loca-ca, loca)
Loca (Loca)
Loca (Loca)
