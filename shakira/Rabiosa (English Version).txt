[Intro: Pitbull]
Woo-ooh!
[Verse 1: Shakira & Pitbull]
Rabiosa
If you don't get enough, I'll make it double
I got my boy now in big, big trouble
You know I want you, atracao' ahí, ratata
You've got a lot of sex appeal
Don't play around because I'm for real (Yeah)
You see that road isn't meant for me
You know I want you amarrao' aquí
[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Oye, papi, if you like it mocha
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca
Oye, papi, if you like it mocha
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca, aha, aha
[Chorus: Shakira]
Rabiosa, ah, ah, rabiosa, ah, ah
Come closer, come pull me closer
Yo soy rabiosa, ah, ah, rabiosa, ah, ah
Come closer, come pull me closer, ah
[Verse 2: Pitbull & Shakira]
Rabiosa
If you don't get enough I'll make it double
I'm trying to have fun, I love you
But you want me, atracao' ratata
You got a lot of sex appeal
Now baby, I'm for real
You see that road isn't meant for me
You know I want you amarrao' aquí

Oye, mami, you let me get that mocha
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca
