[Verse 1: Niall & Liam]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
[Chorus: Harry & Zayn]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
(Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end (until the end)
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between)
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (two of us)
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and I
