[Verse 1: Liam & Niall & Both]
Said I'd never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?
[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
[Verse 2: Harry & Louis]
Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start
[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
[Bridge: Zayn & Liam]
You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
[Chorus: All & Harry & Zayn]
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
(All my heart)
So we can start it all over again
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
(If you're pretending from the start, yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
