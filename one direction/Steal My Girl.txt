[Intro]
[Verse 1: Zayn]
She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I know, I know, I know for sure
[Chorus: All, Liam & Harry]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright

The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright
