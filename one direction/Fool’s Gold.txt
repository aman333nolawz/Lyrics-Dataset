[Verse 1: Niall]
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star
[Chorus: Harry & All]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold
[Verse 2: Liam]
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty, and I can't see two feet in front of me
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part
[Chorus: All]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold, oh
[Bridge: Zayn]
Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels, that's not the way you feel
[Chorus: All]
And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold
