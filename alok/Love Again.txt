[Verse 1]
When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
It's been six days now with insomnia
Try to touch my skin, but I feel nothing
I just think of you, don't know what to do
[Pre-Chorus]
Clock is tickin' now and I hear the sound
Like an empty song playin' all day long
And I move my feet, but I feel no beat
I pretend to smile, but I cry inside
[Chorus]
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
[Verse 2]
When the sun goеs up, when the sun goes down
All thе things I do to get rid of you
Try to make new friends, try to go outside
And I act okay, but it's not the same
[Bridge]
I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
[Chorus]
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
[Bridge]
Tell me how
How, baby? I need to know, oh
Tell me how
How? 'Cause my heart's icy cold, oh
[Chorus]
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
Tell me how will I, I, I ever learn, learn, learn
Learn to love, love, love, love again?
