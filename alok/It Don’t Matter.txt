[Intro]
(It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be)
('Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget)
(It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be)
('Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody)
[Verse 1: INNA]
Tell me now
Why do I still hear you when you're not around?
Why do I keep thinking about you way too loud?
Wherever I am, mmm
[Chorus: INNA]
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
[Verse 2: INNA]
All night long
All night long I'm feeling like you're close enough
Close enough to touch me 'til I get that rush
Wherever I am, mmm
[Chorus: INNA]
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
[Bridge: Sofi Tukker]
If I could sink myself into your skin, I'd try to
I wanna bathe in the air you breathe in
I feel you dance in my mind even when I'm alone
Want you to know...
[Chorus: INNA]
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like a song I can't forget
It don't matter where I go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody
[Outro]
It don't matter where I go
