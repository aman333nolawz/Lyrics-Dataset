[Intro: Conor Maynard]
Pray
Pray
[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Show me where you wanna go
[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And now I'm craving
For your love I’m caving in
But how you gonna leave me now
Just throw it away
All my tears are falling
I will
[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Pray
I thought I'd leave you
But I will stay
Never gonna run away
Eh eh, eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh
Every time you call my name
I will pray
[Post-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Pray
I thought I'd leave you
Pray
Never gonna run away
Eh eh, eh eh
Every time you call my name
I will pray
[Verse 2]
They say, calm, calm the storms
Something we can’t find at all
[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And now I'm craving
For your love I'm caving in
But how you gonna leave me now
Just throw it away
All my tears are falling
I will
[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Pray
I thought I'd leave you
But I will stay
Never gonna run away
Eh eh, eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh
Every time you call my name
I will pray
[Post-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Pray
I thought I'd leave you
Pray
Never gonna run away
Eh eh, eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh
Every time you call my name
I will pray
[Outro: Conor Maynard]
