[Verse 1]
Hate to love it
Hate to love the way you keep me burning
Burning for your touch when you don't give it
Give it to me only when you need it
I know you need it
[Pre-Chorus]
But when you come my way, when you come my way
Put it all on me, but you never stay
Ain't goin' home tonight (Ain't goin' home tonight)
Unless you come with me
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na
[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say good—bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Love me wanting
Somеthing 'bout me craving gets you going
A taste in еvery space that we're alone in
Then tease me on the dance floor 'til the morning
Yeah, 'til the morning
[Pre-Chorus]
But when you come my way, when you come my way
Put it all on me, but you never stay
Ain't goin' home tonight (Ain't goin' home tonight)
Unless you come with me
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na
[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say good—bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
[Bridge]
The way you play me, I can't control
Just wanna be the one who gon' take you home
You tell me that you want it, you want it too
But keep me waiting
[Outro]
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say good—bye, bye, bye, bye (Don't say goodbye)
Night, night, night, night, night (One more night)
Right
Don't say goodbye
