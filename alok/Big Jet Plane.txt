[Verse 1]
Hello mister, pleased to meet you
I wanna hold her
I wanna kiss her
She smelled of daisies
She smelled of daisies
She drives me crazy
She drives me crazy
[Chorus 1]
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Be my lover
My lady river
Can I take you
Take you higher
[Chorus 2]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
[Bridge]
Gonna hold ya
Gonna kiss you in my arms
Gonna take ya away from harm
[Chorus 1]
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
[Chorus 1]
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
