[Intro: Zeeba]
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
[Verse 1: Zeeba]
I know you'll get stronger
When you get older
Just don't shrug your shoulders
When you get older
[Pre-Chorus: Zeeba]
The things aren't easy
So just believe me now
If you don't keep it cool now
You'll never make a sound
[Chorus: Zeeba]
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
[Verse 2: Zeeba]
Leave excuses aside
Speak out your mind
And don't let it slide
You're not always right
[Pre-Chorus: Zeeba]
The things aren't easy
So just believe me now
Don't learn the hard way
Just let me show you how
[Chorus: Zeeba]
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
[Outro: Zeeba]
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
