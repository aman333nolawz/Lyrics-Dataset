[Verse 1: IRO]
I saw an angel looking at me
Her eyes won't open no more; hurt, they can't to see
And then I tried all night, I couldn't sleep
All she wanted was to go to the sea
[Chorus: Zeeba]
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm on my way, I'm on my way
To the ocean
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean
[Verse 2: Zeeba]
I saw an angel, now I believe
Her tears don't fall down no more
It's mine that you see
[Chorus: Zeeba]
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm on my way, I'm on my way
To the ocean
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean
[Post-Chorus: IRO]
To the ocean, to the ocean, to the ocean
[Verse 3: Zeeba]
And now I understand, now she is free
I hope to see her someday
Smile in the sea
[Chorus: Zeeba]
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, mom
'Cause I'm on my way, I'm on my way
To the ocean
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean
[Verse 4: IRO]
Wish I told you I loved you more
Maybe I was lost before
Showed affection to only gold
While the sunset made me cold
I swear I won't complain no more
Doesn't matter if we're rich or poor
Found out that we don't live to die
Even though there is no reason why
I know I heard you cry
I'll leave, but you'll be fine
I don't think you'll be lonely now
Forgive me if I let you down
I won't complain no more
Doesn't matter if we're rich or poor
I found out we don't live to die
I know there is a reason why
[Chorus: IRO, Zeeba]
Don't worry, momma
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, momma
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
To the ocean
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean
[Outro: Zeeba]
To the ocean
