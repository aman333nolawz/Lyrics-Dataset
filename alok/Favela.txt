[Verse 1]
As the sun rises
She opens up her hazel, beautiful eyes
And begins
Her baby cries
She picks him up and tells him beautiful lies
Again
[Chorus]
She come from the favela-la
Hills of Santa Teresa
Underneath the Redeemer
And the sun in the sky
She come from the favela-la
Ask me e aí, beleza?
Underneath the Redeemer
Where the hills come alive
[Post-Chorus]
She works the favela night
She works the favela night
Favela
She works the favela night
[Verse 2]
And the wind blows
She lives on lonely streets where nobody goes alone
Just a young girl
Born on the left side of this right-handed world
She knows
[Chorus]
She come from the favela-la
Hills of Santa Teresa
Underneath the Redeemer
And the sun in the sky
She come from the favela-la
Ask me e aí, beleza?
Underneath the Redeemer
Where the hills come alive
[Post-Chorus]
She works the favela night
Favela
She works the favela night
Favela
[Bridge]
Deep in the colors and the streets
Lost in the funk favela beats
Prisioneira
Dancing in the favela
Safe in the Ipanema bays
We raise a glass on holiday
It's a lopsided world
When you're a girl
Born into nothing at all
[Chorus]
She come from the favela-la
Hills of Santa Teresa
Underneath the Redeemer
And the sun in the sky
She come from the favela-la
Ask me e aí, beleza?
Underneath the Redeemer
Where the hills come alive
[Post-Chorus]
She works the favela night
Favela
She works the favela night
Favela
She works the favela night
