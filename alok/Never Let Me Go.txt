[Verse 1]
It took my whole life just to feel it
Now all this feelings never let me down
A thousand places, everywhere I go
I feel the hearts beating
And even far, this is my home
Oh, it never let me go
[Chorus]
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, never let me go
[Verse 2]
Now it's you that I believe in
Cause all this feelings never took me down
A thousand places, everywhere I go
I feel the hearts beating
And even far, this is my home
Oh, it never let me go
Oh, it never let me go
[Chorus]
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, never let me go
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, never let me go
Oh, never let me go
