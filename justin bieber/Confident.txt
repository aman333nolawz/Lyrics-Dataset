[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothin' like that, uh-uh
Like a fantasy in front of me, yeah
I think that something special is going down
That's right, I think she foreign (Foreign)
I think she foreign (Foreign), got passports
Mi amor ('Mor) started slow (Slow), got faster
She gon' work some more (More), work some more (More)
No stopping her now (Now, now)
No stopping her now (Now, now, now, now)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good, damn (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict
Got me twisted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Explosive, explosive
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
She said it's her first time (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why (IGH!)
I'm addicted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict (Ooh-woo!)
Got me twisted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
Chance? The Rapper? IGH!
[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper & Justin Bieber]
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk (Oh?)
She ain't got a heart or an ass, just her brains
Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve (Oh?)
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note (Oh?)
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat (IGH! IGH!)
Stay faded like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate when I rock the boat (IGH!)
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll (IGH!)
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" (Ooh!)
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team, IGH!
She's confident
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict
Got me twisted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
[Outro: Justin Bieber & Chance The Rapper]
Still I gotta have it (Yeah)
Still I gotta have it (Alright)
Still I gotta have it (Yeah, alright)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no (Yeah)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no (Alright)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no (Yeah)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
But still I gotta have it
