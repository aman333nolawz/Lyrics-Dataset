[Verse 1]
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
[Chorus]
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (Ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends? (Can we be friends?)
Can we be friends? (Can we be friends?)
Can we be friends?
[Verse 2]
Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left (Since I left)
Wonderin' if you think about me (Uh-huh)
Actually, don't answer that (Uh-huh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
[Chorus]
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (Ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends? (Can we be friends?)
Can we be friends? (Can we be friends?)
Can we be friends?
[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
[Chorus]
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (Ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
