[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I need you the m-, I need you, I need you the m-, I need you
I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-
I need you the m-, I need you, I need you the m-
I need you, I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-
You the m-, the m-, the m-
I need you the most
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, canâ€™t deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave ya (I didn't leave ya)
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya? (Need ya)
Where are you now that I need ya?
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure (That's for sure)
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the, I need you, I need you the, I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the, I need you, I need you, I need you the most
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I need you the most (I need you the most)
