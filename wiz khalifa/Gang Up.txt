[Intro: PnB Rock]
O-ay-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah (Yeah)
[Chorus: PnB Rock & 2 Chainz]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, yeah we 'bout to go up (Yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up (Skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us (Yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (Yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (Stayed down)
And came up (Came up)
And came up (Came up)
We stayed down (Stayed down, yeah)
We came up (Came up)
The gang up (The gang up)
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz (Yeah)
I'm a villain that's winning
With precision, I'm killing
Represent the religion
Ended up independent
Took my car to the clinic
Let 'em check all the vitals
Middle finger to rivals
Michael Jackson, my idol (Woo)
Still ducked in a pie hole
Talk to the plug everyday except Cinco de Mayo (True)
I still got me a Carlo
Still got Monte Carlo
Your car running so bad, it stink up the Apollo
Call my Rollie a Ralo (Uh)
Call my AP a "ap" (Ap)
I ain't talking seat belts when I say that I'm strapped (Pow)
I'm in love with my side ho
I'll sneak her through the side door
I'ma show you what we ride for
I'ma show you what we die for
[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, yeah we 'bout to go up (Yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up (Skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us (Yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (Yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (Stayed down)
And came up (Came up)
And came up (Came up)
We stayed down (Stayed down)
We came up (Came up)
The gang up (The gang up)
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm in my same lane, lane and I ain't gon' ever change up
I blowed the brain out the range like a Taz Angel
Here's R.I.P. to Paul Walker, homie got his stain up
We had your main on us, now we got stains on us
And all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (What we gotta do?)
Yeah, I got her Indian, she Western (Yeah, she Western)
Yeah, I just had sex with one of your best friends (Damn)
Then that Fast and Furious started nesting (Sheesh)
Say I'm 'bout to go take off on you (Take off on you)
Is you staying, is you rolling like a scroller? (Yes, you are)
You're ready to take off like a 1980 Coke? Yes (Yuh!)
He know that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that? (Yuh!)
[Chorus: PnB Rock & Wiz Khalifa]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang (Yeah), yeah we 'bout to go up (Yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up (Skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us (Yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (Yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (Stayed down) (Forever)
And came up (Came up)
And came up (Came up)
We stayed down (Stayed down)
We came up (Came up) (I got exactly what you need)
The gang up (The gang up)
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & PnB Rock & Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, I'm always with my gang
We always ready to ride 'cause for the squad, we'll do anything
Stay down, we'll never change
We always gon' stay the same
Put you in check, when you outta place
I try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang
We do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain
I'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane
Know you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang
I got the world on my back (Back)
I put your girl on her back (Back)
I did it all on my own (Own)
Now there ain't no turning back (Back)
And my whole squad got my back (Back)
And shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang, she said, "Facts" (Facts)
Gang, gang, gang
[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Gang, gang, gang, yeah we 'bout to go up (Yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up (Skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us (Yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (Yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (Stayed down)
And came up (Came up)
And came up (Came up)
We stayed down (Stayed down)
We came up (Came up)
The gang up (The gang up)
