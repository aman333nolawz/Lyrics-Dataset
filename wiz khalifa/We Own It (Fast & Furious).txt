[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!
[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with?
This moment (Uh), we own it
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you lookin' for me, you can find Wiz
In a new car or the crowd with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
Ain't no other squad I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo) (Uh)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside, uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)
[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
One thing about it: got a problem? I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it
[Outro: 2 Chainz & Wiz Khalifa]
Hahaha
Uh
This moment, we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live, so here we go
This moment, we own it
