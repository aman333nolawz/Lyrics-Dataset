[Intro]
Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit
I get done with one, and move right on to another bitch
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, college-educated, she graduated
Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it
The show was far, you the only one with a car
And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chase it
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it
Value player, hotel room, meet you there
[Bridge: Empire of the Sun]
Walking on a dream
How can I explain
Talking to myself
Will I see again
[Chorus: Empire of the Sun]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing
Bitches I Taylor Gang that
They just wanna know where the planes at
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up drunk, go to sleep fucked up
We both amazed at what we just done
Mixing drinks, knowing we'll regret this
Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringing us breakfast
All this money, darling, what else is left to do
But smoke and enjoy my presidential view
Got a swimming pool in my living room
On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume
[Chorus: Empire of the Sun]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing
Bitches I Taylor Gang that
They just wanna know where the planes at
[Verse 3: Empire of the Sun]
Don't stop
Just keep going on
I'm your
Shoulder to lean upon
So come on
And deliver from inside
All we got is tonight
That is right, 'til first light
