[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Right Now Sound

So, hol' up
[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
'Cause I can't stop lovin' you (Ooh, yeah)
Since I got a taste of your love (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, oh-woah)
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Goddamn, you know who I am
Try to be on the low, but you ain't slow
Keep my shirt open, eyes low
Get a lot of paper, I know
But you ain't into that, you like real facts
Like, if you show love, you gon' get it back
Like, if you fuck good, you gon' get it back
Like, if you cook, wanna a real nigga that
Gon' rap 'til that pussy like (Uh, uh)
We can go and get a private room
We can fuck for one night, ain't gotta jump the broom
Say your nigga, chill

Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
'Cause I can't stop lovin' you (Ooh, yeah)
Since I got a taste of your love (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, oh-woah)

All that body, baby, it's not fair
Pull up on that ass in a drop, yeah
That's your ex, nigga? I'm dead!
Lookin' for a real one? You found it!
California King, we gon' go rounds on it
No doubt, yeah, leave your legs shakin'
