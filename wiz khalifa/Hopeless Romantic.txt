[Intro: Swae Lee]
Young Chop on the beat
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Turn the music up for me, Chris
She's gonna get, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line (Bang my line)
Off that drank it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
She don't allow herself
To miss nobody else
I've had days where I was dolo (Where I was dolo)
But I never caught a bad case of FOMO (Don't miss out)
Don't talk to me about your previous
You know I'm that times two
Penthouse jumpin' from the front to backroom
Girls goin' wild, showin' off new tattoos (Tattoos)
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line (Bang my line)
Off that drank it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We get aggressive (We get aggressive)
You be undressin' (You be undressin')
Makin' a mess and (Makin' a mess and)
Cleanin' it up when we done
I got a serious question (Serious question)
Do you like sex? If you thinkin' yes
Then I'm tryna test you (I'm tryna test you)
Say young Khalifa the best
But I got money to get (I got money to get)
I gotta hop on a jet (I gotta hop on a jet)
Probably don't call, I'ma text (Probably don't call, I'ma text)
Hop in my car, it get wet (Hop in my car, it get wet)
I’m gettin' all of my checks (I'm gettin' all of my checks)
I’m winnin' all of my bets (I'm winnin' all of my bets)
No, I ain't lettin' you down
Baby, I'm givin' a hundred percent
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line (Bang my line)
Off that drank it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I can't keep my mind off you (My mind off you)
I can't keep my mind off you (My mind off you)
I can't keep my mind off you (My mind off you)
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time (All the time)
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line (Bang my line)
Off that drank it's hard to focus (Focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though (Arrangements though)
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
