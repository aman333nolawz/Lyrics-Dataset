[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up (Liftin' me up), liftin' me up (Yeah)
And tearin' me down (Down), tearin' me down (Down, down, yeah)
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done (Yeah)
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one (Yeah)
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Shawn Mendes]
What if I, what if I trip? (Oh)
What if I, what if I fall? (I fall)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Let me know)
And what if I, what if I sin? (Oh)
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah (What if I break?)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Oh, please just let me know, yeah)
[Outro: Justin Bieber & Shawn Mendes]
La-da-da-duh-duh (Baby, what if I fall down?)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-duh-duh (Please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh (Oh, please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
