[Intro]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
[Verse 1]
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
[Pre-Chorus]
Something in you-ou-ou lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
[Chorus]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
[Post-Chorus]
One
One
One
One
[Verse 2]
I just wanna feel your skin on mine
Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile
Take my time
[Pre-Chorus]
Something in you-ou-ou lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
[Chorus]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
[Post-Chorus]
One
One
One
One
[Bridge]
See a wonderland in your eyes
Might need your company tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Something in you-ou-ou lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
[Chorus]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
[Post-Chorus]
One
One
One
One
