The king and his men
Stole the queen from her bed
And bound her in her bones
The seas be ours
And by the powers
Where we will, we'll roam
Yo, ho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die
Yo, ho, haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die
Some men have died
And some are alive
And others sail on the sea
â€“ With the keys to the cage...
And the Devil to pay
We lay to Fiddler's Green!
The bell has been raised
From it's watery grave...
Do you hear it's sepulchral tone?
We are a call to all
Pay head the squall
And turn your sail toward home!
Yo, ho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die!
