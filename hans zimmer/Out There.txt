[Verse]
I pray
Yeah, I'm hoping that if I pray
Maybe you'll talk back
'Cause I pray for some faith, some faith today
[Pre-Chorus]
This walk feels longer in the dark tonight
No hand to hold, no end in sight
I pour my heart out to the blackest sky
Oh, spirit, can you hear my soul's cry?
[Chorus 1]
Can you hear my call? Can I have a sign?
'Cause I am losing hope
Yeah, on my darkest night
[Pre-Chorus]
This walk feels longer in the dark tonight
No hand to hold, no end in sight
I pour my heart out to the blackest sky
Oh, spirit, can you hear my soul's cry?
[Chorus 2]
No, I don't wanna walk alone, I want to believe
'Cause I am losing hope
As love will speak to me
Can you hear my call? Can I have a sign?
'Cause I am losing hope
Yeah, on my darkest night
[Outro]
I got a feeling you're out there
I got a feeling you're out there
