[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with a new resolve
Two hands and one heart, let the world revolve
One eye to the ocean and one to the sky
One life of devotion and where am I?
One heart to love within my chest
One life to live
[Chorus]
I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
[Verse 2]
One chance to reach out and find a place for me
One chance to find love for all humanity
One eye to the mountain and one to the sands
One dime for the fountain and one for my hand
One heart to love within my chest
One heart to love
[Chorus]
I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
[Interlude]
Love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just comes — none knows whence — and cannot explain itself
Love is a madness, if thwarted it develops fast
When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain
[Chorus]
I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
