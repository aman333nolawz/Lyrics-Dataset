[Verse 1]
Have I made you cross?
Have I made you sad?
Have I made you proud, Mom?
Will I ever know
How white is the snow?
Does it matter after all?
Will I ever learn
How to fly like birds?
Maybe
In an hour
In a day
In a week
In a thousand weeks
In a year
In a million years
[Verse 2]
Are you good as gold?
Are you far from hope?
Are you well?
Hello, Dad?
Will I be a brave
Will I be a bright
Will I be a good grown-up?
