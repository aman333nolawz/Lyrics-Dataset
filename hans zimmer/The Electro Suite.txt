Something's happening
Mind destructing, agony inside of me
My pulse is racing
Mental torture, self-destroyer
Can't ignore the paranoia
Something's happening
Mind destructing, agony inside of me
My pulse is racing
Mental torture, self-destroyer
Can't ignore the paranoia
Something's happening
Mind destructing, agony inside of me
My pulse is racing
Mental torture, self-destroyer
Can't ignore the paranoia
Mind is aching, body's racing
Pulse is shaky, madness breaking
I can feel the darkness taking over
Denying, the rising
The crying, I'm dying
He lied to me, he shot at me
He hates on me, he lied to me
He shot at me, he hates on me, he's using me
Fragility, electricity
Afraid of me, he's dead to me
He lied to me, he shot at me
He hates on me, he's using me
He's dead to me, he is my enemy
They lied to me, they shot at me
They hate on me, they're using me
Afraid of me, they're dead to me
They lied to me, they shot at me
They hate on me, they're dead to me
And now they're all my enemy
