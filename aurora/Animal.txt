[Verse 1]
You are the victim
The victim of my love
I dangle up on rooftops
Before I push you off
I stand at the headlights
Looking for a corner where I can't be found
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every lover on the battleground
[Pre-Chorus]
You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Chorus]
I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Verse 2]
Isolation makes me hungry
Will you stay here till I sleep?
You'll return home in the morning
But you never really leave
I keep the memories alive
The weight upon my shoulders felt so divine
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every step I take before I die
[Pre-Chorus]
You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Chorus]
I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Post-Chorus]
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
[Bridge]
Let me become an animal
Let me become an animal
'Cause when you are an animal
You lose control
[Pre-Chorus]
You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
You make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Chorus]
I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
[Outro]
I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal (Ho, ho)
