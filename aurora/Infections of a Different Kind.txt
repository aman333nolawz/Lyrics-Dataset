[Verse 1]
It's a feeling growing old with time
Like a restless in the leaves calming down
The world is a hole and we all seem to fall
Down under
And the universe is growing tall
And we are caving into dreams of the space
Unfolding our arms cannot do any harm
Violent contractions
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if there is a God, would we even know his name?
And if there is a God, I think he would shake his head
And turn away
[Chorus]
So belong to us all
Be God in the shape of a girl
Who walks this world
And I beg, I beg to be drained
From the pain I have soaked myself in
So I can stay
Okay, and more than okay for a while
For a while, for a while
[Verse 3]
Infections of a different kind
The world has been attacked by our pain
If I am the world then why would I hurt
All that is living?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if there is a God, would he then believe in us?
And if there is a God, I think he canâ€™t hear all of us
[Chorus]
Belong to us all
Be God in the shape of a girl
Who walks this world
And I beg, I beg to be drained
From the pain I have soaked myself in
So I can stay
Okay, and more than okay for a while
For a while, for a while
[Outro]
This is the breath, this is the breath
