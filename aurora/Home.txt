[Verse 1]
Lost in the moment again
Stuck where the road has no end
Keeping the thought in our minds
One day life will be kind
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not alive
We are surviving every time
We are not alive
Only dreams inside our minds
[Chorus]
We are home
We are home
Home
We are home
We are home
Home
[Verse 2]
Endless days of complaints
Forcing the light to our veins
Keeping the hope in our minds
One day life will be kind
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not alive
We are surviving every time
[Chorus]
We are home
We are home
Home
We are home
We are home
Home
[Post-Chorus]
Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from
[Chorus]
We are home
We are home
Home
[Bridge]
Calm again, ca-ca-calm again
I feel warm again, I'm reborn again
I am warm inside, for a little while
I am fine...
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not alive
We are surviving every time
[Outro]
Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from
We are home
We are home
Home
Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from
We are home
We are home
Home
