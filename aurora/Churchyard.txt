[Chorus]
He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me, how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard
[Verse 1]
Words pointy like arrows
Wounds no one can see
He closed all the windows
As his anger broke free
I will not remember
You as somebody nice
Please, will you remember me
And cry?
[Chorus]
He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me, how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard
[Verse 2]
Hate followed him gently
Black seeds in his heart
Roots tearing the love in him
Apart
[Chorus]
He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me, how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard
