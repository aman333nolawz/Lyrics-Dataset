[Verse 1]
I fall asleep in my own tears
I cry for the world, for everyone
And I build a boat to float in
I'm floating away
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't recall the last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
[Chorus]
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior of love
[Verse 2]
I stand behind a wall of people and thoughts, mind controlling
And I hold a sword to guide me
I'm fighting my way
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't recall the last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
Ah ah ah
[Chorus]
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior of love
[Bridge]
Underneath darkened skies
There's a light that don't lie
[Chorus]
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
Warrior, warrior of love
Warrior of love
Warrior of love
