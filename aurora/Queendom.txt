[Verse 1]
The underdogs are my lions
The silent ones are my choir
The women will be my soldiers
With the weight of life on their shoulders
[Pre-Chorus]
Drink until you’ve had enough
I’ll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb
Oooooohhh eyyyyyy yaaaaaa
Ehhhhhhh ahhhhhhh
Oooooohhh ahhhh
[Chorus]
Till Queendom come
Till Queendom come
My Queendom come
My Queendom come
[Verse 2]
The sea waves are my evening gown
And the sun on my head is my crown
I made this Queendom on my own
And all the mountains are my throne
[Pre-Chorus]
Drink until you’ve had enough
I’ll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb
Oooooohhh eyyyyyy yaaaaaa
Ehhhhhhh ahhhhhhh
Oooooohhh ahhhh
[Chorus]
Till Queendom come
Till Queendom come
My Queendom come
My Queendom come
Ahhhhhhhhh, oooooo ahhhhhh
Queendom come
Ahhhhhhhhh, oooooo ahhhhhh
My Queendom come
[Bridge]
I hunt the grounds for empathy
And hate the way it hides from me
With care and thirst I have become
You have a home in my Queendom
You have a home in my Queendom
You have a place in my Queendom
You'll find a place
[Chorus]
Till Queendom come
Till Queendom come
My Queendom come
My Queendom come
Ahhhhhhhhh, oooooo ahhhhhh
Queendom come
Queendom come
Queendom come
Ahhhhhhhhh, oooooo ahhhhhh
My Queendom come
