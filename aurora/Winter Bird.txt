[Verse 1]
Walking in my sleep
Like the naked trees
Will they wake up again?
Do they sleep, do they dream?
[Verse 2]
Feel it as the wind strokes my skin
I am moved by the chill
Hear the winter bird sing
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
[Verse 3]
Silent days, violent shades
We are dancing again
In a dream, by the lake
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
[Bridge]
Rest against my pillow like the ageing winter sun
Only wake each morning to remember that you're gone
So I drift away again
To winter I belong
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
[Post-Chorus]
My tears are always frozen
My tears are always frozen
My tears are always frozen
[Outro]
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
I need to remember
How it was to feel alive
