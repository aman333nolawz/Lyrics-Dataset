[Verse 1]
I don't know why
But I feel down
You need to know
I can't go on
[Verse 2]
I was a rose
I was an animal
Don't let me change
Don't let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
All around is stone
All is soft inside
[Chorus]
All that I know
Lies within emotion
Words remain unspoken
Lead me through the dark
All that I see
Came to me in colours
Lasted for a moment
Lead me through the dark
All that I know
All that I
(Ah, ah)
[Verse 3]
I need it all
I don't know where to begin
I carry more than you see
My dreams are bigger than me
[Verse 4]
Please bring me light
I bear a shadow
I call them back to me
So they could feed on me
[Pre-Chorus]
All is stone
And all is soft inside
[Chorus]
All that I know
Lies within emotion
Words remain unspoken
Lead me through the dark
All that I see
Came to me in colours
Lasted for a moment
Lead me through the dark
All that I know
All that I
(Ah, ah)
[Outro]
Did you know
That we're all
Turning softer inside?
We can save
What is pure
If the hearts can collide
All that I've ever known
Is the universe is wild
Is the universe is wild
