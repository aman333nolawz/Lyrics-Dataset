[Intro: AURORA]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse 1: Idina Menzel]
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh
[Refrain: Idina Menzel & AURORA]
Ooh
Oh
Ooh, ah
[Verse 2: Idina Menzel]
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
[Pre-Chorus]
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
[Refrain: AURORA]
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse 3: Idina Menzel]
What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?
[Pre-Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go
[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
[Refrain: AURORA]
Ooh
Ooh, ah
[Bridge: Idina Menzel, AURORA & Both]
Oh
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?
Ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Outro: Idina Menzel & AURORA]
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you (Ah)
Into the unknown? (Oh, oh)
