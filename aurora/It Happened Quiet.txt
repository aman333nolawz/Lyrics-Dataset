[Verse 1]
Eyes blue and hollow
As it rains against their will
Feathers falling out of a pillow
As if time's standing still
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't remember much more
But I know it happened quiet
So quiet
[Chorus 1]
Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the Earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild
[Verse 2]
You fell apart
Like a stone can be broken into sand
A thousand pieces
Spread across a crying land
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you can't remember that day
But you know it happened quiet
So quiet
[Chorus 1]
Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the Earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild
[Bridge]
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?
[Chorus 2]
Don't you speak over my voice
I will return from the shadows
And I'll bleed in your bed
Turn it red
Like the ground outside your window
Love is wild
[Outro]
Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild
