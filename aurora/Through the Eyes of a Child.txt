[Verse 1]
The world is covered by our trails
Scars we cover up with paint
Watch them preach in sour lies
I would rather see this world through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child
[Verse 2]
Darker times will come and go
Times you need to see her smile
And mothers' hands are warm and mild
I would rather feel this world through the skin of a child
Through the skin of a child
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
When a human strokes your skin
That is when you let them in
Let them in before they go
I would rather feel alive with a childlike soul
With a childlike soul
[Outro]
Hey oh, oh hey
Oh hey
Ah-ah hey
Oh hey
Hey oh, oh hey
Oh hey
Ah-ah hey
Oh hey
Please don't leave me here
