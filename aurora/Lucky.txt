[Verse 1]
When, when I am down
I lay my hands upon this ground
For the thousandth time
I call him in, his earth is mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Before I make the offering
Remember all the faces that I've seen
Now all the marks have settled on my skin
From all the different places that I've been
That I've been
[Chorus]
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
[Verse 2]
War inside my mind
Behind my eyes, is coming down
And for the thousandth time
I feel too numb to even mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Before I make the offering
Remember all the faces that I've seen
Now all the marks have settled on my skin
From all the different places that I've been
That I've been
[Chorus]
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
[Bridge]
I, I don't know where I am, or where I'll go
Where to even begin when I know
What lies behind makes no sense in my mind
But I know that it's time to let go, oh
[Chorus]
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel the light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
[Outro]
I'm lucky to be alive
I'm lucky to be alive
