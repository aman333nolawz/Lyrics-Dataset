[Verse 1]
Can you tell if I'm cold?
If I'm out of daydreams?
If I lose what is loved
Will a new love awake me?
I am touched by wonder
When I'm blind in the dark
[Pre-Chorus]
But you drown me in daylight
Don't swim with me darling
I prefer the sound of you
When you are away
[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love
[Verse 2]
I forget how emotions dance when they aren't inside of me
I forget how the sun feels when she isn't around me
And my dreams become sweeter when something is missing
I'm in love with the hunt itself
It makes me feel alive, alive
[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love
[Verse 3: in imaginary language]
Reslianna Faresuu
Hongaaah firlessiranna
Faressu hongaaah
Firelessinaniree suranna
Rukireee rukireee
Resilanna faresuu
Hungaaah
Firelessina firelessina firelessina
[Bridge]
I release my body and there is no ghost of you inside my mind
I am moving on and thank God you let me try
You are the reason I can dance
Within a fire of goodbyes, of goodbyes
I can lie in a dark room without the feeling that I'm lonely
Oh, (It's the beauty in forgotten love)
[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah (It's the beauty in forgotten love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah  (It's the beauty in forgotten love)
