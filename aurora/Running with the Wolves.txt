[Verse 1]
Go row the boat to safer grounds
But don't you know we're stronger now
My heart still beats and my skin still feels
My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears
But we're runnin' out of time (Time, ah)
All the echoes in my mind cry
[Pre-Chorus]
There's blood on your lies
The scars open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shinin'

There's blood on your lies
The scars open wide

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
[Bridge]

I'm running with the (Oh)
I'm running with the wolves (Oh)
I'm running with the (Oh)
I'm running with the (Oh)
I'm running with the (Oh)
I'm running with the wolves (Oh)
[Chorus]
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the
