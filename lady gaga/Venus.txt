[Verse 1]
Rocket number nine take off to the planet, to the planet (Venus)
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, garden panty (Venus)
Let’s blast off to a new dimension, in your bedroom (Venus)
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, get with me (Venus)
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus (To the planet)
[Chorus]
When you touch me I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love (Venus)
[Verse 2]
Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-ishy, act sleazy (Venus)
Worship to the land, a girl from the planet, to the planet
(To the planet)
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus (To the planet)
[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
[Post-Chorus]
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love (Venus)
[Bridge]
Neptune, go
Now serve Pluto!
Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus (Uh-huh)
Uranus, don’t you know my ass is famous?
Mars, now serve for the gods
Earth, serve for the stars
[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
[Outro]
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love
(Venus)
