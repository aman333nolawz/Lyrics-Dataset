[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, Both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight I'm dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
[Outro: Lady Gaga]
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry (We're sorry)
